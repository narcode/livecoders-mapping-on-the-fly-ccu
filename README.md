# On-the-fly live coding mapping survey

## [Creative Coding survey is on the creative coding branch](https://github.com/narcode/livecoders-mapping-on-the-fly-ccu/tree/creative-coding)
## [CCU, please use the hangar branch or the last release, not master](https://github.com/narcode/livecoders-mapping-on-the-fly-ccu/tree/ccu)

 on-the-fly is a project to promote Live Coding practice, a performative technique focused on writing algorithms in real-time so that the one who writes is part of the algorithm. Live coding is mainly used to produce music or images but it extends beyond that. Our objectives are: supporting knowledge exchange between communities, engaging with critical reflections, promoting free and open source tools and approaching live coding to new audiences. The project runs from 10/2020 to 09/2022, is co-founded by the Creative Europe program, and is led by Hangar in collaboration with ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Ljudmila and Creative Coding Utrecht.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

## requirements
Make a python venv and install the following:

- mysql (for the database)
- aiohttp & gunicorn (for the server)
- aiohttp_middlewares
- aiomysql & sqlalchemy (to communicatie with the database)

## inititlization values (if you will make a custom build from with Elm)

You will need to create a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:
ELM_APP_DEV_URL
ELM_APP_PROD_URL

# start the backend server for development (of course better in a venv)
`gunicorn server:app --bind localhost:8080 --worker-class aiohttp.GunicornWebWorker`

# deployment
1. Make the database with the sql script inside the database folder
2. Adjust the db connection config inside server.py (lines 92-93). It is better to create a special user for this database.
3. If using Nginx or Apache make a proxy to the python server
4. To start the server via systemctl you can use the gunicorn.service inside the backend folder. Fill in the correct parts (your_*) and place it in you /etc/systemd/system/ and then
    `sudo systemctl start gunicorn.service`
5. Check if everything worked with `sudo systemctl status gunicorn.service`
6. If everything looks fine then `sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.service`
7. For the frontend put the contents of the release folder inside the folder you will be serving 
8. Make sure server.py has the correct CORS policy (line 102)
